I am a 20-year-old Bulgarian student. I graduated high school in the summer of 2022 and earned a professional qualification as an applied programmer. I know various programming languages, including C#, Java, and a little Python for backend, HTML, CSS, and a little JS for frontend, and MySQL, MSSQL, and OracleSQL for databases. In addition to that, I have studied functional programming with Haskell and embedded systems with Arduino and C++.
