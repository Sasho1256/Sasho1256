Hi 👋 My name is Alexander Milachkov

Qualified Programmer and Web Developer
--------------------------------------

I am a 21-year-old Bulgarian developer. I graduated high school in the summer of 2022 and earned a professional qualification as an applied programmer at TUES Sofia, in association with Technical University Sofia. I know various programming languages, including: PHP, C#, Java, and a little Python for backend; HTML, CSS, TypeScript and React for frontend; MySQL, MSSQL, and OracleSQL for databases. In addition to that, I have studied functional programming with Haskell and embedded systems with Arduino and C++. My most recent job was as a Junior PHP Engineer for Gravital HR between March 2024 and January 2025
